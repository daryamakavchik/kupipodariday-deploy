## Description 
"KupiPodariDay Deploy" is a portfolio project created as an assignment for [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/web/ "Web Development Program"). It is a wishlist service, where registered users can pick a kind of gift they would like to receive, as well as chip in for others, indicating the amount they're willing to spend.

[Backend part](https://github.com/daryamakavchik/kupipodariday-backend)

This work was aimed at learning deployment to a remote cloud server. For this, I created a remote server based on Linux Ubuntu at [console.cloud.yandex.ru](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/) and registered two domains (domain for frontend and subdomain for backend) at [domains.nomoreparties.site](domains.nomoreparties.site). 

What was also done:
* .env files for frontend and backend
* pm2 deployment scenarios
* Firewall and Nginx set up
* SSL certificates (available at both https and http)
* Docker and Docker compose set up on a remote server
* Docker containers and images for website deployment
